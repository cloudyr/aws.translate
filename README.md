**aws.translate** is a package for [AWS Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/), an Amazon Web Services machine translation web service.

## Code Examples

The basic use of the package is super simple and revolves around the `translate()` function, which takes a character string as input. The result is a character string with 2 attributes: `SourceLanguageCode` and `TargetLanguageCode`.


```r
library("aws.translate")

# translate some text from English
translate("Hello world!", from = "en", to = "fr")
```

```
## [1] "Bonjour le mondeÂ !"
## attr(,"SourceLanguageCode")
## [1] "en"
## attr(,"TargetLanguageCode")
## [1] "fr"
```

```r
# translate some text to English
translate("Hola mundo!", from = "auto", to = "en")
```

```
## [1] "Hello world!"
## attr(,"SourceLanguageCode")
## [1] "es"
## attr(,"TargetLanguageCode")
## [1] "en"
```


## Setting up credentials

To use the package, you will need an AWS account and to enter your credentials into R. Your keypair can be generated on the [IAM Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) under the heading *Access Keys*. Note that you only have access to your secret key once. After it is generated, you need to save it in a secure location. New keypairs can be generated at any time if yours has been lost, stolen, or forgotten. The [**aws.iam** package](https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.iam) profiles tools for working with IAM, including creating roles, users, groups, and credentials programmatically; it is not needed to *use* IAM credentials.

A detailed description of how credentials can be specified is provided at: https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.signature/. The easiest way is to simply set environment variables on the command line prior to starting R or via an `Renviron.site` or `.Renviron` file, which are used to set environment variables in R during startup (see `? Startup`). They can be also set within R:

```R
Sys.setenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" = "mykey",
           "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" = "mysecretkey",
           "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" = "us-east-1",
           "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN" = "mytoken")
```


## Installation

You can install this package from CRAN or, to install the latest development version, from the cloudyr drat repository:

```R
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("aws.translate)

# Latest version passing CI tests, from drat repo
install.packages("aws.translate", repos = c(getOption("repos"), "http://cloudyr.github.io/drat"))
```

You can also pull a potentially unstable version directly from GitHub, using the `remotes` package:

```R
remotes::install_github("cloudyr/aws.translate")
```
